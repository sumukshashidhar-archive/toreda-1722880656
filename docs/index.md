# What is Toreda?

A trader, is known as a _toreda_ in Japanese. This is the best embodiment of what we hope to achieve. 

Toreda is an online trading bot, which takes in historical data of closing prices and develops investment strategies. It is built on the principles outlined in [this] paper.

# Development of Toreda

As of May 2020, the development of Toreda is closed source, due to intellectual property rights. However, it will be opensourced in the month of Jan 2021.

Documentation is currently being written to allow the community to contribute. Commercial use limitations will be implemented shortly

# Using Toreda

Toreda uses Deep Learning to project stock prices and plays out "episodes" to develop trading strategies. This involves a lot of computation power as it goes through billions of possibilities to minimise risk and maximise profits. While it will always be free for those who wish to run the source code on their servers or locally, we have to charge a small fee, so that we can cover the costs of running and maintaining our instances. We hope you can contribute.
