# Approach

With toreda, it is not our idea to maximise profit, but rather maximise the number of times we turn a profit over our initial investment. 

For example:

It is not our intention to make a 5000 dollar profit by selling our stocks at the peak time, but rather, to make one dollar profits, 5000 times a day. This is the point of high frequency trading


# The LSTM Network

It is not possible to predict prices by using just the LSTM model. This is because the agent is not aware of external events that might affect the stock price. This is why, we use a three pronged approach
