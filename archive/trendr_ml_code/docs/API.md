# Getting the API Keys

To access our network, you will need the API keys, which can be obtained by following the instructions specified [here](https://github.com/sumukshashidhar/toreda/blob/django-frontend/docs/API-KEYS.md)

Remember, you must keep these keys to yourself, as they are tied to your account. We at Toreda are not responsible for the misuse of your API key.
